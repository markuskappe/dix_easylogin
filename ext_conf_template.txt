  # cat=basic; type=boolean; label=Add realurl configuration: Disable this if you use the autoconf feature from realurl. When enabled, the realurl configuraion will be extended with the GETvar "tx_dixeasylogin_pi1[action]".  When disabled, the realurl configuration will still be extended, but only if you use the autoconf feature from realurl. When you have chosen to manually configure realurl and disable this option, the GETvar "tx_dixeasylogin_pi1[action]" will NOT be translated. This is bad, because facebook has a problem when working on a page that conains a question mark "?". For more info see the documentation of dix_easylogin and realurl.
